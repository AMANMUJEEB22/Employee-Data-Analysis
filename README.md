# Employee Data Analysis Project  

## Overview  
This project analyzes employee data from ABC Company using Python. The analysis includes data preprocessing, team distribution, salary insights, and correlation analysis, with visualizations for better understanding.  

## Dataset  
- The dataset consists of **458 rows** and **9 columns**.
- Contains employee details like team, position, age, salary, etc.
  
## Preprocessing Steps  
- Corrected data inconsistencies in the "height" column.
- Replaced missing values with appropriate methods.
- Ensured data consistency before analysis.

## Analysis Tasks  
1. **Distribution of Employees Across Teams**  
2. **Segregation of Employees by Position**  
3. **Identifying the Predominant Age Group**  
4. **Team and Position with Highest Salary Expenditure**  
5. **Correlation Between Age and Salary**  

## Visualizations  
- **Bar Charts** for team and position distributions.  
- **Histogram** for age groups.  
- **Scatter Plot** to analyze the correlation between salary and age.  

## Insights  
- The most populated team is **[X Team]**, while the least populated is **[Y Team]**.  
- Employees aged **[X-Y] years** form the majority.  
- The **[Z Team]** has the highest salary expenditure.  
- **[W Position]** receives the highest salaries.  
- **Salary vs. Age** correlation indicates **[strong/weak/no]** relationship.  

## Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (For coding & analysis)
